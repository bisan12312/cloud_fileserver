  <h1>Request deletion of your data (without deleting your account)</h1>
  <p class="muted">Last updated: 2025-09-25</p>

  <h2>How to request deletion</h2>
  <p>Email <a href="mailto:gmaildepthnoteapp@gmail.com">gmaildepthnoteapp@gmail.com</a> with the subject <strong>“Depth Note – Data Deletion Request”</strong> and include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your account email (Google/Apple) or Firebase User ID (UID) if available.</li>
    <li>What you want deleted (for example: AI request history held by processors, support emails we received from you).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We will verify your request and confirm when the deletion is completed or explain any limitations.</p>

  <h2>What we can delete</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Account-associated records we control (e.g., support communications).
    </li>
    <li>We will forward deletion requests to our processors where applicable (e.g., AI providers) for data reasonably linkable to your account.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What is not deleted by this request</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Store purchase records</strong> retained by Apple/Google and RevenueCat for billing, tax, and fraud prevention.</li>
    <li><strong>Aggregate analytics/crash telemetry</strong> that is not reasonably linkable to you; providers automatically age out this data per their retention policies.</li>
    <li><strong>Your notes and images stored on your device</strong>; these are local and not uploaded to our servers. You control them on your device.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Alternative: Delete your account</h2>
  <p>If you prefer to permanently delete your Depth Note account, open the app → <strong>Settings</strong> → <strong>Delete account</strong>. This removes your Firebase user and detaches your purchase entitlement from the account. Subscription billing must be cancelled separately in the App Store or Play Store.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>Data requests contact: <strong>Bisan Idrees (Israel)</strong> – <a href="mailto:gmaildepthnoteapp@gmail.com">gmaildepthnoteapp@gmail.com</a></p>
